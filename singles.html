                    <h1>THE SINGLES</h1>
                    <p class="text-break">
                        The album produced several chart-topping singles that not only dominated radio waves but also became anthems for a generation. Tracks like <em>“Born This Way,” “Judas,”</em> and <em>“The Edge of Glory”</em> blend infectious melodies with deep, often provocative themes of identity, freedom, and defiance. These songs were not just hits; they represented Gaga's unapologetic approach to pushing boundaries, exploring complex emotions, and celebrating the power of self-expression. Each single offered something unique, from club-ready bangers to introspective ballads, solidifying the album’s place as a cultural milestone. “Born This Way,” made an immediate impact, debuting at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for six consecutive weeks. It broke the record for <u>the fastest-selling single in iTunes history</u> at the time, reaching over 1 million downloads in just five days. “Judas” also performed well, reaching the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, “The Edge of Glory” became Gaga's 10th Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, showcasing her longevity in pop music. Yoü & I, achieved moderate success, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning critical praise for its emotional depth and distinctive sound. “Marry the Night,” while not as commercially successful as some of the album's other singles, quickly gained a cult following. The song’s dramatic, cinematic sound and lyrics about reclaiming one’s strength were praised for their raw honesty and energy.br <br><br>
                        On August 3, 2012, Gaga revealed that her original choice of singles was "Born This Way", "Marry the Night", "Scheiße" and "The Edge of Glory". According to her, Interscope Records didn't allow her to make "Scheiße" a single (probably because "scheiße" means "shit") so she decided to feature the song on the short film created for "Fame".
