                                While accepting the Video of the Year award for "Bad Romance" at the MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga announced the album's title before declaring that she promised she would reveal it if she won that award. This revelation was followed by Gaga singing a few lines from the title song: "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track baby, I was Born This Way."<br><br>
                                Given as a Christmas "gift" to her fans, Gaga announced via Twitter the release dates of the album and its lead single at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day 2011. Supplementing this announcement came a black-and-white photograph in which Gaga is "nude from the waist down, with her hair blowing about, and sporting a jacket with [Born This Way] emblazoned in what looks like bedazzled jewels."<br><br>
                
                                In a further atypical manner, she released the complete set of lyrics to "Born This Way" on her official Twitter page in late January 2011. The names of the five songs that appear on the album were revealed in the March 2011 issue of US Vogue.br <br><br>
                
                                On September 29, 2010, during Paris Fashion Week, Lady Gaga provided the soundtrack for the Mugler fashion show. The runway was accompanied by a mix of songs, including "Born This Way" and other unreleased tracks from the album, giving fans an early preview of what they could expect from her new sound. <br><br>
                
                                On May 18th, UK fans were able to listen to previews of every song on the standard edition album via Metro.co.uk. It was the first and only place to get a sneak peek of all the songs before the album's release.

                            <aside>
                                Due to the religious themes and lyrics in such songs "Judas" and in the track "Born This Way" stating "God makes no mistakes", the Lebanese government banned the album and seized thousands of copies of it upon entrance to Lebanon. The government deemed the album "offensive to Christianity".
                                On May 12th, 2011, Gaga and some fan sites set up an agreement called the "Honesty Box". It's was e-mail account (monstermail@ladygaga.com) where people could send in anonymous tips about leaks from the album to ensure that any leaks wouldn't get widespread distribution. It was said that the owner of the material would not be called to justice, but would be stopped instead in a fair and respectful manner.
